*Trafic perturbé*...again?! This library permits statistical analyses of all these daily incidents occurred on the Paris RATP metro/RER lines.

Using tweets coming from official RATP Twitter accounts ([@Ligne1_RATP](https://twitter.com/Ligne1_RATP) for line 1 for example), we can see

1. What is the probability of encountering some operational incidents on a particular line?
2. Which lines are more likely to cause everybody unhappy?
3. What are the main causes of these problems?
4. Should I be considered lucky if I never take metros during rush hours?
5. Are there less problems during weekends?
6. Instead of going on vacation, is there any reason to be happy if I still work in August?

Some responses to these questions can be found in this [notebook ](https://github.com/tianyikillua/ratpmetro/blob/master/examples/notebook.ipynb)
